# FlowViz - Data visualization for teams using Azure DevOps
### What is it?
This dashboard is for all Agile teams using Azure DevOps (formerly VSTS), who want to leverage their data to have better conversations and make more informed decisions. It was built due to years of frustration with 'velocity' and other traditional agile metrics. These are centered on flow, as well as providing forecasting techniques you can use to give customers greater confidence/transparency in your delivery.

### Prerequisites
* [Make sure you have the latest version of Power BI Desktop](https://aka.ms/pbiSingleInstaller)
* Download the [FlowViz Template](https://github.com/nbrown02/FlowViz/raw/main/FlowViz%20Template.pbit) or even try [Dark Mode](https://github.com/nbrown02/FlowViz/raw/main/FlowViz%20Template%20(Dark%20Mode).pbit)
* Then you're good to get started!

### Connectivity
* Open the .pbit file
* Add your organization and project name

Don't confuse the team name with the project name, a common mistake. If the URL you use is "http://dev.azure.com/Microsoft-UK/AzureDevOpsTeam/Database", then Microsoft-UK is the Organization Name, AzureDevOpsTeam is the Project name, Database is the team name.

* Hit load (note: you may get prompted for a login here, choose organisational account and enter your Azure DevOps email)
* Voila - your dashboard is up to date!
